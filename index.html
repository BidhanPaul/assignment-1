                programming at an early age and majored in computer science and enginerring, or they taught themselves
                how to code
                later in life. These stories focus on how the authors went from being beginning coders to getting that

            <p class="paragraph-style">Software development is such a challenging field that it’s almost impossible to
                succeed in it without having some sort of support system. With the many popular languages, frameworks,
                tools, and libraries available, having someone who can guide or mentor you will significantly increase
                your chances of success in this field.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-style">Everyone needs vaccines. They are recommended for infants, children, teenagers,
                and adults. There are widely accepted immunization schedules available. They list what vaccines are
                needed, and at what age they should be given. Most vaccines are given to children. It’s recommended they
                receive 14 different vaccines by their 6th birthday. Some of these come in a series of shots. Some
                vaccines are combined so they can be given together with fewer shots.</p>
